biography: >-
  Jared is extremely happy to be on WUMT! He did parliamentary speech and debate in high school and now judges and coaches when he can. Jared joined mock trial because he was looking for something new while keeping the same competitive spirit he had in high school. When Jared is not running a part, he may be recording an episode for his podcast called Contested Politics (contestedpolitics.com) or playing cards with his friends. His piece of advice for prospective members is that mock trial is so versatile; he thought he would only like being an attorney but now loves to be a witness. Go WUMT!
