biography: >-
  After being a member of the debate team throughout high school, Arik Wolk
  decided to take on a new form of public speaking with mock trial. No matter
  what role he’s playing on the team, Arik loves working (and joking) with all
  of his teammates. When he’s not doing mock trial, Arik can be found telling
  people about which congressional district they live in, locating historical
  literary landmarks, and hopelessly rooting for his beloved Brooklyn Nets.
