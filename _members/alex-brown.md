biography: >-
  After competing in and loving speech in high school, Alex wanted to try
  something new in college and found that on WUMT. Alex’s favorite parts of mock
  are giving opening statements, doing 30-second crosses, and laughing with his
  regularly-ridiculous teammates. When not doing mock, you can find Alex getting
  a grilled cheese at Holme’s Lounge or watching soap-cutting videos on Snapchat
  to procrastinate doing literally any work (including mock).
