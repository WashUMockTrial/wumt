  After loving competitive speech in high school, Alex decided to continue his passion for public speaking as a member of WUMT. Although he had no idea what he was getting into when he tried out, he's fallen in love with the competition and challenges of college mock trial. His favorite part of mock is getting to collaborate with all of the fun, intelligent and passionate members of WUMT to build smart and complex cases.
