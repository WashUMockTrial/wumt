  After falling in love with Speech in high school, Maggie decided to continue
  her love for public speaking at WashU by joining the Mock Trial Team. While
  she loves playing profusely energetic witnesses, her favorite part of Mock
  Trial is laughing with her silly teammates and eating copious amounts of
  Panera (*St. Louis Bread Company). When she isnâ€™t doing Mock, you can find
  Maggie looking at memes or debating whether or not to get another latte.
