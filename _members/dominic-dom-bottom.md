biography: >-
  Dom Bottom, better known as David Decker's better half, is a freshman on the
  Mock Trial team. After loving mock trial in high school, Dom decided to
  continue doing mock trial in college and he has found it to be an experience.
  Dom is an avid anime fan and would love to talk to you about it. When not
  crying in round as a witness (or an attorney), Dom can be found playing Smash
  Ultimate with his friends, getting lunch with his mock trial big and
  professional cool person Dorian, or being extremely tall around campus.
