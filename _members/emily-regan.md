  When not middling, Emily loves spending time laughing and eating Thai with her fellow WUMT members. Outside of Mock Trial she is a Washington University Student Associate, part of Greek Life, an editor for the WUSTL history journal, and the Women’s Panhellenic Association President. Emily hopes to someday go to law school but plans to pursues a career in lobbying or consulting first. If anyone is reading this and is considering trying out for WUMT Emily’s advice would be DO IT - you could meet some of your best friends :).
