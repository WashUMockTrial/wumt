biography: >-
  After being an active member of her high school's Model UN and Debate teams,
  Emily decided to try a new form of debate at WashU and found her fit with the
  Mock Trial Team. Emily has loved everything about Mock Trial so far,
  especially the people and the proximity to SweeTart chews in the Siegle
  basement vending machine. When not making up ridiculous witness statements you
  can find Emily in Holmes lounge or spending a ridiculous amount of money on
  Starbucks coffee despite an abundance of meal points
