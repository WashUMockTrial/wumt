biography: >-
  Aaron is a Captain in the United States Air Force JAG Corps.  Aaron has
  enjoyed working as a prosecutor and defense counsel in the real world, but not
  nearly as much as he liked competing for the Pennsylvania State University's
  undergraduate mock trial team in college.  Aaron won an All-American Attorney
  award during his first AMTA season, a feat which he followed up by never
  winning any other awards.  â€‹He spends most of his time trying to catch up to
  the number of jury trials his wife and co-coach Dorothy has litigated.
