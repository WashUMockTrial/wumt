  After competing on his high school Mock Trial and Model UN teams, Elijah was excited to join WUMT to continue his passion for debating. You can usually find him playing an expert witness sporting fake glasses, much to the chagrin of his teammates. Outside of mock, he serves as a Justice in the Student Union's judicial body, writes for the Political Review, cooks entire Thanksgiving dinners in his dorm kitchen, and listens to copious amounts of country music.
