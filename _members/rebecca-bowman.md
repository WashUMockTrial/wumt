biography: >-
  Looking to polish up her debate skills from high school, Rebecca joined mock
  trial because it seemed like something she would like. Only entering her
  second year, she has gotten to be an attorney (opening statements were her
  favorite), an expert in digital journalism, and the head of Human Resources
  for an online magazine. If you donâ€™t happen to see her speed walking from the
  40 to practice, you can catch her in BD writing papers until 4 am. Aside from
  mocking, she enjoys poetry, listening to music and dancing. Sidenote: her
  steno is filled with cute spiral doodles and cursive-written song lyrics.
