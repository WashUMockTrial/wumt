biography: >-
  Building on her musical-theatre experience from roles such as a dancing napkin, 
  a 19th-century French thug, and the Grim Reaper, Caroline tap-danced her way 
  through Mock Trial courtrooms and speech tournaments in high school. She is 
  thrilled to begin her second year on WUMT, raising jazz-hand objections and 
  towering over the jury at 6’1” (plus heels).
