biography: >-
  Joseph has always enjoyed public speaking, but now going into his fourth year
  in WUMT he has found a fondness for mock trial unrivaled. Whether it is
  playing the role of an overly eager linguist or delivering opening statements
  about how unjust an elderly person’s firing was, he has gotten to play tons of
  different roles on the team, but more importantly he has joined a close knit
  family in WUMT. When not mocking it up, Joe can be found in the library
  drinking a Caramel Macchiato listening to Taylor Swift while doing
  mathematical proofs or cheering wildly for the Lakers even though they kinda
  suck.
