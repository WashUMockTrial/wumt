  High-pitched? Yes. The butt of jokes on the team? Always. Frantic? Ask any
  WUMT member. But despite this, Joe enjoys the activity as much as everyone
  else on the team. Since joining the team as a freshman, he’s reigned in his
  temptation to read his co-counsel’s steno pads (don’t even think about it) and
  considers WUMT his family outside of Los Angeles. He loves the ability to
  dramatically object as an attorney, play a confident professor in linguistics,
  or simply hang out and sing Let It Go on car trips. His goofy, lovable, and
  passionate personality fits in well on the team, providing occasional laughs
  and smiles in stressful times. On the side, Joe is a Taylor Swift-loving
  sports fanatic who also is amazed by mathematics and computer science (but he
  isn’t your stereotypical nerd).
