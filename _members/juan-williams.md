biography: >-
  Joining WUMT in his freshman year, Juan Williams II has loved his time on the
  team, especially when he gets to conduct a particularly tense cross. He loves
  the opportunities mock trial provides him to practice public speaking and
  critical thinking in the moment. Juan is an avid reader of history and an avid
  watcher of House of Cards. He is not a meteorologist.
