biography: ' Alex, WUMT’s lone engineering student, is finishing his fourth year on the team. Both a senior and a grad student, he’s also the person responsible for WUMT’s new website - the very website you''re visiting. In a trial, you’ll generally find him closing for the defense, but he’s played almost every role there is at some point or another. His true passion, however, is finding obscure sections of the Midlands Rules of Evidence; he dreams of one day making an objection under Rule 1101. Outside of court, he enjoys airplanes, puzzles, and the German language – his favorite word is “verschnörkeln”.'
