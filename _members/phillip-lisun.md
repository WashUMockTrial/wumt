  Phillip was eager to join mock trial following two successful years in Speech and Debate. Although, he enjoys the structure and format of Mock Trial much more. Phillip has interests in international politics, classical music, and a minor interest in chess. Phillip is enthusiastic about mock trial and what he can bring to this year's team!
