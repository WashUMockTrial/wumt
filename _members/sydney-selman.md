biography: >-
  Prior to joining WUMT as a coach, Sydney served as president of her mock trial program at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville and as an assistant coach for a local high school team. She's especially passionate about helping younger members succeed and making the mock community more inclusive. Sydney is notoriously indecisive about her career plans, but as of right now, she'd love a job in law school admissions/career services (subject to change tomorrow). If only mock trial paid the bills!
