biography: >-
  Christiana Ogletree is a law student pursuing a future career in civil rights law. Competing with her mock trial team at Mississippi College was one of the highlights of her undergraduate experience, so she was thrilled to have the opportunity to coach WUMT. Throughout undergrad, she sought to challenge and uplift her peers as a writing tutor, editor of the school's literary magazine, and captain of her mock trial team. She strives to do the same in her time at law school and with WUMT.
