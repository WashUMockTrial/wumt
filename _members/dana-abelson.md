  Ever since Dana created a 35-slide powerpoint in order to convince her parents
  to get her a guinea pig in sixth grade, it was clear she was destined for law.
  She didn’t start with mock trial until college, though, opting instead to do
  theatre and debate in high school. When she’s not embodying Midlands’ favorite
  hostile Burn-Book-making 13-year-old or acting as an attorney, you can find
  her in the upper level of the DUC contemplating her existence and listening to
  Ariana Grande (despite a teammate’s claim that she seemed like the type of
  person who would be a closet Katy Perry fan).
