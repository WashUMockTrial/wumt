biography: >-
  Ever since Dana created a 35-slide powerpoint in order to convince her parents
  to get her a guinea pig in sixth grade, it was clear she was destined for law.
  She didn’t start with mock trial until college, though, opting instead to do
  theatre and debate in high school. During her first year on WUMT, she acted as
  an attorney and a score of witnesses, her favorite being a psychologist. When
  she’s not being told by judges to stop smiling so intensely while spilling
  incriminating information, you can find her in the upper level of the DUC
  contemplating her existence and listening to Ariana Grande (despite a
  teammate’s claim that she seemed like the type of person who would be a closet
  Katy Perry fan).
