biography: >-
  After joining her high schoolâ€™s team on a whim and loving it, Nathalie knew that she wanted to continue mock trial in college. She feels lucky to have found such a great family with WUMT. At tournaments, you can find her playing under-qualified expert witnesses, forgetting how to timekeep, and complaining about traveling to Iowa for the fifteenth time this year. Outside of mock, her favorite hobbies include crocheting, making Spotify playlists, and enjoying not being in Iowa.
