biography: >-
  Nathalie loved doing mock trial in high school and knew she wanted to continue
  doing it in college. At mock tournaments, you can find her playing
  under-qualified expert witnesses, forgetting how to timekeep, and eating
  excessive amounts of peanut M&Ms. Outside of mock, she enjoys tutoring (the
  best) kids through Each One Teach One, eating stir fry at the Village, and
  listening to 538 podcasts on Spotify.
