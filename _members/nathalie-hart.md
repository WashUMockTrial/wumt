biography: >-
  After joining her high school's team on a whim and loving it, Nathalie knew that she wanted to continue mock trial in college. She feels lucky to have found such a wonderful home with WUMT. At tournaments, you can find her playing under-qualified expert witnesses, forgetting how to timekeep, and complaining about traveling to Iowa for the fifteenth time this year. Outside of mock, she enjoys crocheting, working in her psychology lab, and dreaming about working for 538.
