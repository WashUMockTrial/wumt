biography: >-
  I served as Secretary General for my high school MUN program and had debate experience prior to joining WashU Mock Trial. Throughout my time on the team, I have been able to continue my passion for public-speaking in a variety of ways, from impromptu speaking to structured acting. I loved playing interesting expert witnesses with stories to tell and identifying unique themes that represented our case well. Outside of mock trial, I row for WashU and have served as a Teaching Assistant for Management 100.
