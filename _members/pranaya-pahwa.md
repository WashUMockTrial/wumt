biography: >-
  Pranaya finds mock trial a serviceable collegiate extracurricular. He enjoys
  middling and timekeeping. Occasionally he loves to play characters that match
  him in spirit and demeanor, namely bratty teenagers. Entering his second year
  on the team Pranaya is excited to avoid being kicked out of the team and one
  day become a real boy. When not participating in mock trial Pranaya usually
  sits alone in his room pondering the existence of god and the lifetime of
  loneliness that lies ahead. Occasionally he performs this intense reflection
  accompanied by vegetarian Haute cuisine and a stuffed Giraffe named Paul
  Giamatti.
