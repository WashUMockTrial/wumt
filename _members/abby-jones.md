biography: >-
  After not doing mock trial, debate, or drama in high school because she was "nerdy but not <i>that</i> nerdy," Abby soon caved to her dramatic tendencies after meeting her mock trial obsessed roommate in college. She was thrilled to join the team in her sophomore year and has loved creating outlandish characters that judges can describe as "sorta funny but DEEPLY unprofessional."
