  Daniel joined WUMT as a freshman after loving mock trial all four years of
  high school. Daniel says that WUMT was where he met his first (and closest)
  friends freshman year. You can find Dan being an attorney (always missing his
  steno) or playing an overly Jewish witness. Outside of WUMT, Dan runs his own
  on-campus business and interviews potential students for admission to WashU.
