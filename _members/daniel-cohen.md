Hi! I’m Dan. Welcome to my bio. I hope you enjoy your stay. I competed on WUMT for all of my four years as a student at Wash U, performing roles such as Competitor, Captain, and President. After graduating in May 2020, I decided that my time with WUMT wasn’t done yet. While I am now 1,000 miles away from Brookings, I continue to coach WUMT from my apartment in NYC while attending law school at NYU. When I am not coaching WUMT or competing on NYU’s Trial Advocacy team, I can be found playing PC video games or hanging with friends.
