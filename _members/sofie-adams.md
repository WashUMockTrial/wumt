  In round, you can usually find Sofie making best evidence objections (against the coaches' advice), saying "yuh" too much (against the coaches' advice), and keeping the coaches on their toes (against the coaches' advice). Outside of Mock and research, her hobbies include explaining her major to family and friends, winning staring contests, and avoiding conversations about the last chapter of <i>Don Quixote</i>.
