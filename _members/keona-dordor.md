biography: >-
  Like most decisions she makes in life, Keona haphazardly decided to try out for Mock Trial in college and since then, she’s had so much fun & learned a lot. During Mock, you can find Keona accidentally admitting to murder on the stand and unlearning that tendency. Outside of Mock Trial, you can find Keona dragging her friends to Thai Country Cafe and monologuing about which new guy on the bachelor she’s madly in love with!
