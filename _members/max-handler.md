biography: >
  Max is a senior and is WUMT's Executive Vice President. He has been with the
  club since his freshman year, and has done everything from playing expert
  witnesses to delivering closing statements. Max's favorite WUMT moment was
  helping the team to a fifth-place finish at Nationals his sophomore year. He
  has been variously described as "Sasquatch," "Godzilla," "King Kong," "Loch
  Ness," "Goblin," "Ghoul," and "a zombie with no conscience." Outside of mock
  trial, he serves as a staff editor for the Washington University Political
  Review. In his spare time, he likes to waste time.
