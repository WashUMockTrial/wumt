  After four years of high school Speech and Debate, Andrew decided he wasnâ€™t sick of wearing a suit on weekends and happily joined Mock Trial.

Outside of Mock Trial, Andrew serves on the Asian Multicultural Council Exec Board, student government, and enjoys educating coastal elites on Indianapolis suburbs.
