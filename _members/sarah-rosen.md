  After competing in mock trial in high school, Sarah decided to stick with it and join WUMT!  While on mock, Sarah enjoys being typecast as the nice witness and being way too aggressive on cross.  Outside of mock, Sarah loves LaCroix, all things politics and discussing the latest seasons of the Bachelor.
