biography: >-
  David did high school mock trial all four years of high school is very excited
  to be able to continue in college. He is hoping to learn to stand up without
  breaking the sound barrier when objecting and using words that a normal person
  would say. When not doing mock trial he plays super smash bros with his
  friends and becomes frustrated at the French language.
