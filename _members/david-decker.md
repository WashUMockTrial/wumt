biography: >-
  David competed in mock trial all four years of high school and has loved continuing in college. His second-favorite type of tournament (his first being mock trial, of course) is the Smash tournaments he runs in the Lopata Hall basement. While the attire of his Smash friends might be questionable, it's one of his favorite things to do outside of the courtroom. David also enjoys traveling to his favorite city, Paris, and immersing himself in French culture by going on Reddit and finding different Smash tournaments in the area. While in Paris, David also enjoys being frustrated with the French language.
