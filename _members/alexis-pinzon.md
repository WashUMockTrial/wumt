biography: >-
  Alexis joined WUMT eager to continue her mock trial career after loving her
  two years doing high school mock trial. She wanted to learn how to be more
  articulate, take on different characters, and go on road trips around the
  Midwest to better her geography skills. Alexis is a happy-go-lucky kind of gal
  who has a smile on her face most of the time (excluding midterm/finals
  season). Outside of WUMT, Alexis spends her time at the gym working (no, not
  working out) or at the CSC.
