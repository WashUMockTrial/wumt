biography: >-
  After competing on a terrible high school mock trial team, Alex took his
  talents to south (side of Pittsburgh) where he was a four year captain and two
  year president of mock trial at the University of Pittsburgh. In his four
  years Alex earned many individual awards including multiple ORCS awards as a
  closing attorney. Despite his success convincing mock jurors, he has no such
  luck convincing his high school students to do anything at his job through
  Teach for America. His remaining mock trial aspirations are to play a witness
  in a round and to coach a team to nationals. Alex now coaches WUMT where he is
  positive he can accomplish one of those two goals.
