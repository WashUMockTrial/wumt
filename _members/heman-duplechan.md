biography: "Heman is a Sophomore from Cincinnati, OH majoring in Political Science and minoring in Spanish. Some of highlights of Heman’s mock trial career include: successfully sleeping through the night on a very uncomfortable hotel armchair, timekeeping (not), and getting roasted to within an inch of his life by a judge for wearing Nike Elites™ in the courtroom. As you can see, Heman has had a successful and eventful tenure as a mock trial competitor; but don’t just take our word for it! Here’s what a couple of judges had to say about his performance:\r\n\n\r\n\n“You were dope”\r\n\n\r\n\n\\* A Good judge\r\n\n\r\n\n“You were utterly useless”\r\n\n\r\n\n\\- A Stupid Judge\r\n\n\r\n\nWhen he’s not doing mock trial, Heman’s favorite activities include: writing for Studlife, and seeing how long he can listen to Frank Ocean without crying (his current record is 1 minute)."
