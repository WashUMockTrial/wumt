  After being forced to join high school mock trial by her prosecutor mother, Gabi has had to endure nearly one million “I told you so”s after falling in love with the activity. Four years later, she is extremely excited to continue in college and get close with the WUMT team. Outside of mock, she can be found fulfilling every band kid stereotype, spending far too much money on food from the Loop (especially Thai), and being made fun of for getting cold in 60 degree weather.
