biography: >-
  Yan has wanted to participate in mock trial since she was in high school, and
  is ecstatic to have found an amazing team in college. Her mock trial goals
  include winning All-American Time Keeper, speaking human words when arguing
  objections, and setting realistic mock trial goals. Outside of mock trial, Yan
  likes to spend too much time at BD, too much money at Corner 17, and too much
  effort on parallel sentences.
