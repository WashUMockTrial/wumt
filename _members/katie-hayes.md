biography: >-
  A newbie to the mocker community, Katie impulsively joined the mock trial team
  her first year at WashU. Little did she know she would find her passion for
  public speaking and argumentation. You can find Katie giving opening
  statements for both sides, possibly forgetting her badge number while playing
  a shady detective, and trying not to burst out laughing at the fake southern
  accents during round. If Katie is not chugging coffee in Whispers, sheâ€™s
  probably at the St. Louis Zoo, on her futon watching Netflix, or cram studying
  for a test.
