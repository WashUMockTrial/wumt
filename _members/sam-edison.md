biography: >-
    After impulsively joining the Model UN team in high school, Sam became engulfed in debate and learning about the tools to be great at it. After getting to college, Sam decided to try a new form of debate and joined the Mock Trial team. Having some experience in high school with acting, Sam was able to pick up the role of character witnesses such as a corporate goofball or a chilled out chief editor of a prominent journalism magazine. If heâ€™s not joking around with some teammates or friends in the DUC, you can probably catch Sam playing some basketball in the AC or trying to argue with a random student about politics.
