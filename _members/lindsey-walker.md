biography: >-
  Lindsey Walker is a 2L at WashU Law and spent her undergraduate years
  competing for Indiana University's mock trial program. During her time with
  IUMT, Lindsey served as the Tournament Director, gave opening and closing
  statements, and earned ten Outstanding Attorney Awards. Her proudest
  accomplishment, however, was leading her team to its first appearance at the
  National Championship in 2017, where they clinched Fifth Place. In her spare
  time, Lindsey enjoys watching trashy reality TV and experimenting with vegan
  cooking (much to her fianc√©'s disapproval).
