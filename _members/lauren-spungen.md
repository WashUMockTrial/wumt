biography: >-
  Lauren impulsively joined her high school mock trial team after discovering
  Suits, and she has been competing ever since. About to begin her fourth year
  on WUMT, she's had the chance to play a wide variety of roles: attorney,
  psychiatrist, secretary, blackjack dealer, and a 15-year-old psychopath (her
  favorite). When not in class or at practice, Lauren can usually be found in
  Tisch, sipping an extra-large black coffee and working on a crossword puzzle.
  Her favorite read is the Midlands Rules of Evidence, and rumor has it that
  Lauren is writing a short screenplay in her steno pad.
