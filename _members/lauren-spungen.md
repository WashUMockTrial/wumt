biography: >
  Although Lauren might look like— and testify as—a 15 year-old, she is a junior
  beginning her third year on WUMT (and fifth year of mock trial). When not
  enjoying a mid-day siesta in between classes, she can usually be found planted
  at a table in the DUC with an extra-large coffee, a crossword puzzle, and a
  heavily annotated copy of the Midlands Rules of Evidence (her favorite read).
  Lauren’s interests span far beyond mock trial though; she is notorious for
  being an avid James Bond fan, true crime enthusiast, and a coffee connoisseur.
  Unbeknownst to most of WUMT, she has a tendency to be a bit sarcastic. Rumor
  also has it that Lauren is writing a small screenplay in her steno pad.
