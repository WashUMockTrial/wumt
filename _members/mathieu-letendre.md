biography: >-
  Despite not participating in any speech or debate in high school, Mathieu went
  out on a limb and tried out for WUMT. He is an attorney on the team who loves
  making 403 objections to keep out vaguely hurtful case facts and misgendering
  his own witnesses. When not working in studio as an architecture major, Matt
  can be found napping, at the gym, or working questionable jokes into his
  directs.
