biography: >-
  Julia is an undecided freshman from New Jersey and has been part of two SPAMTA
  winning or runner up teams, much to Maxâ€™s dismay. Her favorite memories of
  Mock Trial include reading children's books in the State College, PA airport,
  learning how to pump gas, and bye busting. She enjoys podcasts, the New York
  times, and truly terrible puns.
