biography: >-
  William Satloff is currently in the Sam Fox School of Art. His colleagues
  describe him as, "killing the game," which is mostly accurate with the one
  clarification being that he has already slayed it. When not being a fashion
  icon around Wash. U's campus, William can be found doing Mock Trial. His
  favorite team member is Dorian DeBose, who he thinks is really cool and didn't
  write this. His favorite memory of Dorian was when Dorian saved a pack of baby
  kittens from a fire.
