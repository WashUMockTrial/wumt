biography: >-
  After a few uneventful years of debating in high school, Will decided to try out for Mock Trial in college because the people seemed really nice. What he found on WUMT was a family, as well as a very real passion for being a fake lawyer. When he's not doing mock, you can find Will listening to music, writing poetry, or promoting his album <i>Gravity</i> (which is out now on all streaming services).
