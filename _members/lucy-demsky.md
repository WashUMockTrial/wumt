  After competing in Mock Trial in high school, Lucy is super excited to be on WUMT! Lucy is thinking about studying Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, but she is still undecided. Outside of Mock Trial, you can find Lucy singing in an acapella group or getting lost around campus because she has a horrible sense of direction.
