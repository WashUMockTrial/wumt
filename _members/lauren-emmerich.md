biography: >-
  Despite never doing mock trial in high school (or really any other form of
  debate), Lauren quickly found a love for this team. Some of the best
  experiences in her first year of mock trial were giving opening statements,
  playing a bank robber-turned-expert witness at Nationals, and getting to
  regularly work with her friends. When not doing mock trial, Lauren enjoys
  bingeing Suits, sitting in Whispers for hours procrastinating (usually with
  the Mock Trial team), and working as a research assistant for the
  Interdisciplinary Project in the Humanities.
