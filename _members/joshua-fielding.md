biography: >-
  After competing in debate in high school, Josh decided to shift gears and found WUMT. His favorite moments in his career so far include competing at regionals, placing at Penn State, and of course discovering all the Midwest fast food chains and colleges. Outside of mock trial, you can find him playing Madden or watching terrible movies with his friends and at BD on Tuesdays for Chicken Tikka Masala.
