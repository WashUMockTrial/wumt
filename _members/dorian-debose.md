biography: >-
  Dorian hails from the greatest flyover state West of Missouri: Kansas. In
  between his weekly wheat staring competitions, he picked up debate and
  forensics in high school. He believes that mock trial combines the best
  aspects of all three activities: the argumentation of debate, the fun acting
  of forensics, and the constant grind of wheat staring. When heâ€™s not mocking
  trial, Dorian is busy running bits, changing his major and writing for
  Studlife.


  Dorian is also the owner of the critically acclaimed twitter account,
  @verbosedebose. He views retweeting him onto your feed as community service.
