biography: >-
  Danny was inspired in high school to try mock trial after a summer internship
  at a courthouse. He enjoys the public speaking, quick-thinking, and creativity
  components of mock trial, so he naturally decided to continue in college. When
  he isnâ€™t at mock trial, Danny is probably working at a marketing agency,
  serenading women with his euphonium (pronounced: U-phone-E-um), or exploring
  St. Louis.
