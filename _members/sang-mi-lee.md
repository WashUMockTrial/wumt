biography: >-
  Sang-Mi (song-me) didn’t know that her high school had a mock trial team until it was too late. Now, she plays witnesses with useless information and makes the opening statement too argumentative. In the rare times she’s not slaving away on mock, you can find her singing to no one’s enjoyment or attempting to find temporary peace in video games. As of this time, she’s happily engaged to Sofie Adams and can’t wait for their wedding.
