  After being surrounded by WUMT at the activities fair her freshman year, Sang-Mi (SONG-me) has since fallen in love with mock trial. Some classic court occurrences for “Light ‘Em Up Lee” are getting argumentative objections sustained against her on cross, not realizing how distracting her constant hair adjustments are, and staring blankly as an objectionable statement flies by. When not slaving away at mock, you can find her cuddling with her dogs or playing video games! As of now, she and Sofie are happily engaged and eager to be wed.
