biography: >-
  Having loved mock trial in high school, Pilar joined the team freshman year
  and has enjoyed every moment. She is about to begin her third year on WUMT,
  and she loves being an attorney, especially doing closing statements. Her
  favorite part about mock trial is the bonding that happens on road trips to
  tournaments. When not in class or at practice, Pilar is probably napping, at
  the gym, or in the BSBA lounge procrastinating and drinking too much coffee.
