As the team\u2019s resident southerner, Will is most commonly found trying to extract testimony from bawling \"children\" or testifying about how he definitely didn\u2019t rig his re-election campaign (he promises). Will also serves as the team chocolatier, responsible for the creation and transportation of one of the team\u2019s favorite snacks, his homemade chocolate peanut-butter \"Tiger Butter.\" When he isn\u2019t making delicious treats or emulating Atticus Finch (in the original novel- not the new racist one) Will can be found reading up on history, standing in line for his daily ration of pasta, jamming to woefully outdated music, and generally being an enormous nerd. But if you ask him nicely, he may just share the Cajun spice he keeps in his backpack with you.\n\n__Will's Individual Awards__\n\n__2015__:\n  - Regionals: All-Region Outstanding Attorney (16 Ranks \u03a0)\n\n__2016__:\n  - Regionals: All-Region Outstanding Attorney (18 Ranks \u03a0)", "major": "History & Film Studies", "name": "Will Hancock", "type": "Member"}
