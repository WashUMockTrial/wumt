{"graduationYear": 2019, "joinYear": 2015, "title": "Vice President of Recruitment & WUMT Events", "hometown": "St. Louis, MO", "biography": "Pilar joined WUMT because she loved her experience in high school mock trial and wanted to learn how to make even more sophisticated, well-articulated arguments. Winning her over from the start, mock trial became her favorite activity at Wash U due to the fabulous people on the team and crazy roadtrips. She's particularly a fan of when we stop at Perkins in Iowa for their heavenly chocolate French silk pie, which is often. She's known for her killer attorney moves, making judges smile as her Argentinian-accented witness on bye-buster teams, and her on-point Shakira impressions. Outside of WUMT, she enjoys politics, history, reading (crime novels, especially), and Game of Thrones.", "major": "International and Area Studies, Minor: German", "name": "Pilar Gonzales", "type": "Member"}
