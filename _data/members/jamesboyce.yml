He\u2019s originally from Manalapan, New Jersey, and graduated from Washington University in 2014. This will be his first year coaching the team that he competed on for four years. He played character witnesses and expert witnesses, he opened, middled, and closed, and he was recognized as an All-American Attorney.\n\nDuring his four years on WUMT, James honed his exaggerated Jersey accent, emphasized the importance of signage, invented units of measurement, ate more hotel breakfasts than he can count, mastered the art of packing a suitcase, won awards, competed across the nation, practiced directs in front of random passersby, mentally objected during lectures, participated in more trials than some actual lawyers, went through half a dozen notepads, made some horrendous objections, made some good objections, performed speeches to the wall in the hallway, went to Nationals four times, and, most importantly, met some amazing people. They're the real reason he came back year after year. Now that he\u2019s graduated, he\u2019s excited he can start giving back to the program that gave him so much.", "photo": "/static/data/member/media/39zAWnbzsIIgSMcqqyqqy4.png", "name": "James Boyce", "type": "Coach"}
