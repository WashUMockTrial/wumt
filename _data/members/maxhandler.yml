He credits WUMT as one of his favorite things about Wash U so far (we're flattered, but it also makes us think Max needs to get out more). He spent most of last year playing a passionate expert witness and causing his teammates to freak out before trials by threatening to do an impromptu accent. Outside of WUMT, Max writes a blog for the university's political review and minors in classics due to his love of Latin. He's always up for playing FIFA, talking politics, and trolling people. \n\n__Max's Individual Awards__\n\n__2015__:\n  - Richard Calkins Invitational: Outstanding Attorney (18 ranks \u03a0)", "major": "Minor: Classics", "name": "Max Handler", "type": "Member"}
