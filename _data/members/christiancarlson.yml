biography: 'Christian joined WUMT as a freshman looking to try out something completely
  new, having not even known what mock trial was before he came to WashU. He believes
  that WashU has really helped him ease into the college experience, and he''s had
  an absolutely great time with it. You''ll often find Christian playing some absolutely
  wild and wacky character witnesses, whether that be a security guard a-la Paul Blart
  or a snooty card dealer. Christian presents a distinct image that is characterized
  by his zesty passion for Chubbies, patterned shorts that show off his self-described
  beautiful legs. Outside of WUMT, Christian is in pursuit of quality aesthetics,
  whether that be with attempts at poetry or the promise of a "dope" mixtape. '
