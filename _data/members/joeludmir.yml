But despite this, Joe enjoys the activity as much as everyone else on the team. Since joining the team as a freshman, he\u2019s reigned in his temptation to read his co-counsel\u2019s steno pads (don\u2019t even think about it) and considers WUMT his family outside of Los Angeles. He loves the ability to dramatically object as an attorney, play a confident professor in linguistics, or simply hang out and sing Let It Go on car trips. His goofy, lovable, and passionate personality fits in well on the team, providing occasional laughs and smiles in stressful times. On the side, Joe is a Taylor Swift-loving sports fanatic who also is amazed by mathematics and computer science (but he isn\u2019t your stereotypical nerd).\n\n__Joe's Individual Awards__\n\n__2015__:\n  - Arch Invitational: Outstanding Attorney (18 Ranks \u0394)   \n  - Arch Invitational: Outstanding Witness (17 Ranks \u03a0)\n  - Billiken Barristers' Invitational: Outstanding Attorney (17 Ranks \u03a0)\n", "major": "Mathematics", "name": "Joe Ludmir", "type": "Member"}
