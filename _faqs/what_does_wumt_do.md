title: What does the Mock Trial team do?
answer: |
    We work with our coaches to prepare both sides of a fictitious legal case that is authored by the
    [American Mock Trial Association](https://www.collegemocktrial.org/). During a competition,
    students act as attorneys and witnesses and argue both the prosecution/plaintiff and defense sides of the case.
