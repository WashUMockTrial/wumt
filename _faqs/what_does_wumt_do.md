title: What does the Mock Trial team do?
answer: |
    We work with our coaches and advisors to argue both sides of a fictitious
    case that is authored by the American Mock Trial Association. During competition,
    students act as lawyers and witness and argue both the prosecution and defense
    side of the case.
