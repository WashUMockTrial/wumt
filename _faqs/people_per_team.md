title: How many people are on a team?
answer: |
  Each team consists of up to eight people, but contains, at
  a minimum, three attorneys and three witnesses. It's very common for students
  to play roles on both sides of the case. WUMT often sends multiple teams to tournaments
  so that many students are able to participate.
