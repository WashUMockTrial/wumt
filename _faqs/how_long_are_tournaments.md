title: How long are tournaments and competitions? Who judges you?
answer: | 
  Tournaments usually last two to three days. They are always held on weekends.
  During a tournament, we compete in four trials. Each trial will last a minimum
  of two hours and no more than three hours. We're judged by law students, practicing
  attorneys, judges, and, at the National Tournament, even State Supreme Court Justices!
