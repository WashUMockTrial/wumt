title: How long are tournaments? Who judges you?
answer: | 
  Tournaments usually last two to three days. They are always held on weekends.
  During a tournament, we compete in four trials. Each trial will last between two and 
  three hours. We're judged by law students, practicing attorneys, judges, and, at the 
  National Tournament, even State Supreme Court Justices!
