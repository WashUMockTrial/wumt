title: How is college Mock Trial different from high school Mock Trial?
answer: >
  There's no need to worry if you didn't participate in Mock Trial in high school. Some of our best competitors competed at the high school level while
  others first learned about the activity when they arrived at WashU. The most notable difference between high school and college Mock Trial is the presence of
  "extra" witnesses. In high school, most states don't let you choose which witnesses you can call to the stand, but in college you (and your opponent) both get
  that chance. There are 8-12 witnesses in the case, and you don't learn until a half-hour before the trial begins which witnesses will be in the round, meaning that
  every trial is different, and trials more spontaneous and fun. There are also subtle differences in time limits, objections, and, depending on what state you competed in, the number of attorneys (three per side in college).
