title: How is college Mock Trial different from high school Mock Trial?
answer: >
  There's no need to worry if you didn't participate in mock trial in high

  school. Some of our best competitors competed at the high school level while
  others

  first learned about the activity when they arrived at WashU. The most notable

  difference between high school and college mock trial is the presence of
  "extra"

  witnesses. In high school, most states don't let you choose which witnesses
  you

  want to call to the stand, but in college, you (and your opponent) both get
  that

  chance. There are 8-12 witnesses in the case, and you don't learn until a
  half-hour

  before the trial begins which witnesses will be in the round, meaning that
  every

  trial is different, and making trials more spontaneous and fun. There are also

  other subtle differences in time limits, the applicability of certain
  objections,

  and, for some people, the number of attorneys (3 per side in college).
