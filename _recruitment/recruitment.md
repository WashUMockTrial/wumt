      Judging simply by the name Mock Trial, one might assume that this activity
      is only for future lawyers, but WUMT highly values its actors as well. It
      is the job of those who play witnesses to creatively develop a
      multifaceted character based off of a set of facts and a goal (the
      information provided in a legal document called an affidavit) rather than
      a script. Witnesses both have to be able to sustain a direct examination,
      which is more of a structured way of portraying their character, and a
      cross examination, a chance to show off improvisational skills. Mock Trial
      is one of the most unique and challenging ways to use your talents and
      expand your skillset, and we are always looking for more actors to join
      our team.

      Mock Trial is a great opportunity to develop your public speaking skills
      and establish your own voice, enhancing your charisma and persuasiveness.
      Attorneys also work to strengthen their analytical/critical thinking
      skills as they come up with creative solutions to seemingly contradictory
      parts of the year’s case in order to develop the most innovative case
      theories. They will be required to learn how to adapt to unexpected
      situations and think (and speak) on their feet, a skill that is
      transferrable to both interviews and everyday conversation. As a bonus,
      our attorneys acquire real-life legal knowledge on trial proceedings and
      the rules of evidence that have helped many of our graduates succeed in
      law school!
